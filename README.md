# ML-Project

Hello ðŸ‘‹

This work uses Disney as a case study to classify users' sentiments during controversial statements.

Tweets from 2019 (when Halle Bailey was cast) and September 2022 (when the first teaser from Little Mermaid live-action was released) were extracted using SNScrape and used as my dataset.

The work starts on [exp1]_ML_Nathalia.ipynb where I test positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. In my second experiment ([exp2]_ML_Nathalia.ipynb), I test for a more polarized basis, that is, using only positive or negative sentiments.
